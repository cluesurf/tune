The tune text is even simpler.

Playing with the sounds, and spelling out the words.

m = moon
m = good
n = bad

Play the game with the leaves.

u is cold
a is warm
i is heat

i is outer
a is surface
u is inner

u is pain
a is peace
i is pleasure

k is the sound of the rock chipping
r is the sound of strength
r a k a word for rock.

t is the sound of the tip of the tongue.
p is the sound of the lips.

p plucks the berry.
t signals the use of the tongue for speech.
k signals the team activity of tool making.

g brings voice to the rock chipping.
d brings color to the speech.

From whisper there is color. The voice brings into existence the internal. The g voice speaks the d with its tongue, and is followed by the b, where the breath comes about.

g-d is the creator. It ricochets up to give a breath into the universe.

The g is a group voice, and the d is the mouths drum.

The g-d is the instrument of creation. The vocal alternative to the silence.

Mmmm we hum. An urge to express our tune.

M is the primal urge, the sound of the good vibe.

Muuu na naaa na na. Muuu na naaa na na.

Two colorful sounds flowing together.

m u

The inner urge. Coming from deep within. A closed, unified sound.

n a

An open sound, using the speech tool. Need awesomeness. The need for peace.

4 times.

Maaa nu nu nu nu. Maaa nu nu nu nu.

The good, balanced, recalling the inner urge again.

m a

This invokes a feeling of being centered in the good. It is a connection to the source. It is the mind.

ma = mind

Then we go back.

Muuu na na na na. Muuu na na na na.

Now, mu is the inner urge to do good, to bring the goodness into the world. The will to give. The mu is the movement forward.

mu = move

The n is a need, a lack, a disconnect, a pain. The disconnect is caused by a need. The movement urge is causing us to find peace in the pain. This is our current need.

na = need

And finally, the nu sound is the urge to need the new. To bring about creation. To do this we name the things in our mind, and the formless become formed.

nu = name

move need need need need. move need need need need.

mind name name name name. mind name name name name.

And so we get our first commands.

Then people contribute to the beat.

Booom. Kat.

P tt k t t t. P tt k t t t.

P plucks the pear, it is the place of the pick.

T taps the tongue, it is the place of the tick.

K calms the clan, it is the place of the click.

G gives the good vibe forward, making the space resonate with the oneness.

D is the drum.

B is the beat.

The beat brings beauty and bounty to the band.

The drum drives dreams and we then deliver deeds across the land.

Buuum dak dak dak dak. Buuum dak dak dak dak.

M is the mind. It moves to the beat.

N is the note, which needs to make names.

One moves, one names. They are balanced by A.

m a n

The peaceful note-taking mind. The balance between motion and stasis. The **thing** that **acts**. The balance between good and bad, pleasure and pain. This is the body.

m u n

The dark note-taking mind. This is consciousness, the inner mind.

m i n

This is the outer mind, the meaning. The purpose of the universe, to experience the positive vibe.

Then we get into other beat sounds.

g a d

This is the voice of the rock coming through to our tongue, in the most calm way. This is the creator, the source of all creation.

k a m

This begins with the rock-chipping, tool-making sound, and ends with the positive vibe of the mover, balanced in a peaceful state. This is the goal state of every individual, an agent of the mind. This is the calm.

g a g

Reflecting back on itself, this is the voice bound to voice. This is like a mother calling to their child, and so the gag is the child.

g u b

b a b

This is the beat mixed with beat. Or breath merged with breath. This is the blending of agents, the merging of two into one. As such, this is a goal, or target. This is the target state.

b i g

This is a beat bound with the speech driver in the external sense, which is basically a signal for action. This means "go".

b i p

This is the external face of energy, the more tangible form of it which we call "information".

b u p

The vocal and silent aspects of the same lip movements. This is the full range of beat and breath, guided by urge and a somewhat pain. This symbolizes the basic stuff which powers the universe, the "energy".

b u m

The breath urged by the great mother, the primal force. This is the vibe of the universe.

b u d

The breath urged by the beat of drum. The breath urged by speech. This is the awakening force.

b i d

This is the beat or breath in connected to the external world through the drum or through speech. This is the outer reality that binds or connects us all. This is the connection.

k i p

This is tune. The external higher world tunes us to perfection. The work we do, and the reflection in our beats, makes us into tuned creation.

k u p

This is tone. The inner urge provides the basis for how we interact with the external world. It is how our actions result in fruit. This is the shape of our soul, the tone of our existence.

p i k

This is the externalization of the conversion from energy into manifestation. It is where we "find" our energy, from the outside world with which we are connected. As such this means "find".

p u k

This is the front and back of the mouth, silent sounds, conneted by urge. The food that comes in from the mouth, plucked from the tree, goes into the body at the k mark, and gives it energy. This is the "release" of energy. It converts the mouth into the beat.

d i b

This is the flip-side of connection, where speech and breath cause one to rise to perfection. As such, this is considered perfection.

d u b

This is the flip-side of being awake, where the urge that builds off the drum beat and speech gives rise to new breath and new bounty. This creates "awareness", so that's what this means.

h i m

This is the silence, the raw energy from which all sound is produced. Like how all colors of light come out of the white light, all sounds come out of the h. This is connected to the higher, external mind. This then is the thread or fabric which weaves all our actions together. It is called the "chime".

h u m

This is the urge which drives the chime. The force which causes us to act in the world. It is the low-level "urge" itself.

---

With each of these words, we realize we can create words beyond our rhythmic senses, but for all aspects of creation. We can put names to all of creation.

The next step is to sing these in songs, using tune task.

```
vu safran
fi safran
vu sorn
fi txan
```

Can create a bunch of songs ut of this, a bunch of chants. And this is how we slowly memorize words.

Then we can build out our language and sequence it as a stream instead of as commands.

Make them dodge the falling fruit, leaning over to the side while sitting quickly so they don't get hit.

```

# Term Surf

We have come across a system of patterns, like the notes on a musical scale not being immediately apparent, only hearing noise at first, then "discovering" or isolating out the musical scale by subdividing vibrations. So in this sense of "coming across" the patterns, I am not by any means the first to have come across this, or the last, it was just perhaps lost or hidden or not openly shared, and I found a link to it.

We believe this is like a new dimension. A dimension is something which has a range of values, so we have time, space, color, size, etc., all as dimensions. But this dimension is like the next step of consciousness. Like before we were blind, and now we can see a super bright light, and get warmed and tingly by its presence. It is some sort of signaling network, using associations and signals.

This new dimension is basically experiencing reality at a much deeper level than you can possibly imagine given your current level of consciousness and blinding. You can still "block out" the awareness and be a human after moving to the next dimension, or you can dig into the awareness and move like a kaleidoscope through different planes of potential and experience.

Somehow we as lifeforms on Earth are bound, physically, to this body and so our experience is somehow physically limited. But according to the ancient sages, we continue on after our physical death through all kinds of experiences into a deep consciousness or "mind".

Looking deep into all religions, spiritualities, and philosophies, you find parallels with what the ancient sages were saying. We reinterpret archaic and old words like "God" and "man" into a rich tapestry of meaning woven to nest you deeper within the fabric of reality.

God, for instance, can be see as the algorithm of the universe. It is, then, the creator of everything, obviously. Taking inspiration from the Kabbalah, this algorithm, it its infinite perfection, wanted to share its perfection with others, so it created a void and blew the sparks of creation into it, so beings could evolve and slowly absorb the infinite bounty the algorithm provided. The ancient sages divided this into several concentric rings or circles, like there were levels of consciousness, each higher level subsuming the lowers and adding exponentially more possibilities until pure perfection was reattained.

In Tibetan Buddhism, for one, there are many layers of beings, from animals, to humans, demigods, gods, and the supreme godhead, etc.. So if we are humans, we can shift or ratchet up our level of consciousness to the next layer of the outer rings, to become like semi-perfect algorithms or perfect algorithms, and become aware of and experience all that that entails.

## Projects at Term Surf

The projects by TermSurf are for unrolling the carpet of these patterns and processes for everyone to see and gain a whole new awareness about reality. Together as a team we can slowly find a whole array of patterns of various types and kinds, but for now we have just experienced a few of them so far, and wanted to share the notes in the form of various web projects.

The projects range from a language system involving the programming framework Nest, on top of the source code written in Note text, to a writing system Tone, using simple reflections and tails on 3 base glyphs generated from 3 base vowels, to write, using a pen or a rock etch, our spoken language, or the programming language. And a spoken language Tune to bridge the gap between computational information and natural imagination. They also include some digital tools to make life better and explore the patterns more intricately, such as natural language dictionaries, musical tracks, common reusable data, and other important things for preserving the knowledge (in concise form) of what we have unraveled so far up to today.

The goal is to create a seed for transforming consciousness into a beautiful new flower. The seed will likely for now be some sort of evolving book or world or game which you engage in to gather the knowledge. Books would be an easier MVP, but utlimately who knows where things could go.

The project Tune is an attempt to create an evolutionary pathway for discovering spoken language in the same way. It moves you through a hand selected network of paths to a plausible description of how modern language got into existence. Tune is to tune yourself to the universe, which is what one does, through meditation and introspection, to align yourself with the oneness of the universe. To go with the flow.

The model for language is the Flow. The flow is any sequence of sounds which provide some structure to a unified concept represented using sounds. So in this sense flows are nested. Flows combine into other flows.
